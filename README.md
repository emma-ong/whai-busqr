##About the App - 'busqr'

Minimum Viable Product: 
- A 7-day project completed in the final week of EDA's Whai 2022 Cohort 
- As a team of 3, we built an app intended for buskers to set up an online profile 
  which also generates a downloadable unique QR code that links users to this page. 
- This profile page allows users to make dummie online payments to support their busker. 

Feature to be implemented soon: 
- Payment method service (eg. GooglePay)
